Write a program which asks a user to input an age in human years, 
and converts it to the equivalent age in dog years.

Dogs have different lifespans than humans. 
Thus their age is sometimes reported in "dog years" which 
are scaled to be comparable to human ages. 
On average every calendar year is equal to 7.18 dog years. 
To convert 3 calendar years to dog years, you multiply 3 * 7.18 to get 21.54 dog years. 
That means, if your dog is 3 years old, they're past their teenage years!
